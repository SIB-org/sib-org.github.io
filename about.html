    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To create a culture of initiative, collaboration, and leadership by empowering students to bring their ideas to life and contribute meaningfully to the school community.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Our Structure</h2>
    <p>The SIB is currently run by a team of more than 10 members across different sections of Class 9, led from our organisational HQ in 9E. Each member takes on a specific role, ensuring every project is handled with care and precision. Additionally, our Ambassadors represent the Board in their respective sections, helping us stay connected with students across the grade.</p>

    <h2>Gratitude</h2>
    <p>“A grateful mind is a great mind which eventually attracts to itself great things.” – Plato</p>
    <p>We thank our founder and the executive team for pioneering in this organization, spearheading it into what it is today, and appreciate the work done by our ambassadorial staff to help grow and spread the SIB.</p>
    <p>We cannot omit the cultivation of our spirit of inquiry by our teachers, and the demonstration of leadership and inspiration by our principal, headmaster, and headmistress which has led us to create this organisation.</p>
    <p>Last, but not at all the least, we must pay credit to our fellow students, whose cooperation made everything possible, whose participation made our events lively, and who are the reason we exist.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Ready to be part of the change?</h2>

    <p>Let’s build amazing things together.</p>
